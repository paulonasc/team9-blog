Job satisfaction is extremely important for employees and companies. Happy and satisfied employees ultimately drive productivity, further innovation, and are more likely to show up to work and excel every day.

According to CNBC, in 2021 Adobe was ranked the #1 company with the employees with the highest job satisfaction. The survey conducted by Comparably, looked at several data points such as asking employees if their work environment was positive or negative, if they were satisfied with benefits, felt burnt out, if they were proud to be working at that company, as well as other metrics (CNBC).

Many benefits Adobe offers to their employees is one contributor to it. Adobe offers many various benefits that can elevate their employees' lives, and according to Comparably, 96 percent of their employees are satisfied with their benefits. . Some of the popular benefits include office perk, employee health plan, paid time off (PTO), and financial benefits. 
Among those, their financial benefit, especially their Leaning Funds, can be a great benefit for employees who are planning to resume education while they work.

Adobe’s Learning Funds is a tuition reimbursement program that covers up to $10,000 per year for any degrees from undergraduate to PhD and MBA from accredited institutions for any regular employees including part time employees. 

“Adobe truly invests in continued learning,” Sohit Kapor, Professional Services Account Executive, Adobe India said.

Although this benefit is somewhat fascinating, you might be thinking that most employees would not need any more degrees but some more practical training. Indeed, Adobe’s Leaning Funds provide reimbursement for both Academic degrees and short term learning opportunities for their employees’ professional development. The coverage is the same $10,000 per year. This encourages their employees to develop their professional abilities into another level and supports employees to learn new skills without worrying about how much it would cost. 

Another thing that many employees say about Adobe is that they put a lot of effort into developing better managers and leaders. 

“The company’s approach has made it really easy to bring out some of the better parts of me,” said Yonn Samuels, Director of Software Engineering, Adobe Lehi

Adobe’s investment in developing better leaders can bring enormous benefits to companies in the long run. This will lead to better management and better relationships between their managers and employees. A good relationship with a manager can affect an employee’s job satisfaction significantly. This is also a good motivating factor because this creates lower stress and helps them to better meet the company’s goals and objectives. 

At the same time this can function as a hygiene factor also. A good manager-employee relationship is good for an organization, but a bad manager-employee relationship can be a serious problem for an organization. A bad relationship with a manager is known to be the top stress factor among employees and this often leads to employee turnover or causes lack of enthusiasm among employees.

It seems like all of these factors come together to increase Adobe employees’ job satisfaction. As said in the beginning of the post, highest job satisfaction leads to higher work performance. When companies want higher productivity, they should plan to aim for both employees’ productivity and satisfaction. Many companies should remember happy employees bring the company more than the company put in to make them happy.
