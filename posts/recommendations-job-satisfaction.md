What do you think of when you think of a successful company in the software industry? High performance? Good marketing? Often when we think about “good” companies, we think about how the company is doing as a whole, abstracting the people that make the company successful in the first place. Most probably wouldn’t think of happy employees when they think of a successful company. However, employee job satisfaction is extremely important in all industries, including the software industry.

According to research, there are three factors that are detrimental to job satisfaction in the software industry. The factors are: **excessive work, poor management, and utilizing too many tools**. Next, we will go into each one of these factors in detail and propose solutions on how to fix them. 

The first factor that is detrimental to job satisfaction is an excessive workload. Giving employees an unmanageable workload can cause them to multitask. This, in turn, reduces employee productivity, causing them to spend “25% more time…on each task” (Svitla). Additionally, satisfaction falls when employees are working more than their usual obligations require without receiving additional compensation, unpaid overtime. 

To solve this problem of having an excessive workload, employees and organizations should plan more effectively. An example could be spreading multiple tasks out for a longer period of time. This would allow employees to allocate more time to each assignment and more superior work would be accomplished.

Moving on, another factor that hurts job satisfaction is insufficient management. When employees are poorly managed, they can become unsure of what to work on. Employees that are given unclear objectives will generally be less productive. Think about a time when you have received a project in the past that was unstructured and open-ended. Did you tackle the project immediately with a clear goal in mind? Most likely not. The same problems occur in the software industry with projects that are unrestricted and too flexible.

Insufficient management does not only have to be having questionable goals. A research study from Penn State University found that the satisfaction of employees increases when their supervisor “is understanding, friendly, offers praise for good performance, listens to employees’ opinions and shows personal interest in them” (Peslak). 

The project itself and the relationship between higher-ups and their subordinates can be two areas that can create a hindrance to satisfaction. When your boss is more than just your boss, this can create workplace relationships that enable higher satisfaction and productivity. A survey found that if employees are confident in their manager, their job satisfaction increased (positive correlation). 

There is no one clear-cut answer for solving poor management because every organization is unique. However, a recommendation is to take time off from current assignments to do training instead. These training sessions should teach skills that include, but are not limited to, communication, listening, and empathy. These sessions address the specific problems that are happening within an organization so that the problems no longer hinder productivity.

The third factor to be discussed is the dealing with too many tools used by those in the software industry. A GitLab surveying DevOps teams found that several teams were dealing with 25 tools each. The overwhelming amount of tools caused time to be wasted and processes to be excessive. When the number of tools was decreased and streamlined, it reduced frustration. It also increased productivity and collaboration. 

Dealing with too many things at once can also make employees feel like they are spending time on work that is unmeaningful, which negatively impacts their satisfaction. In summary, sometimes less is more. 

To correct this issue, organizations and teams should discuss together on how to cut back on unnecessary tools. The tools that an organization uses should focus on quality over quantity. This will make processes in the organization more efficient when employees do not have to juggle multiple tools while also dealing with multiple tasks.

In this post, we have addressed three different factors in the software industry that have a detrimental impact on job satisfaction. The factors are: **excessive work, poor management, and utilizing too many tools**. We have also proposed solutions to solve these issues. 

In the next post, we will talk about a company that has the highest job satisfaction. This company makes a program that you probably have on your computer right now. We will talk about why they have the highest job satisfaction and why their benefits may have something to do with it.
