- **Gina** - Two factor theory discusses hygiene and motivational factors, as two critical factors affecting employees’ motivation level.  According to Herzberg, motivating factors motivate employees and increase their job satisfaction when given to them. Hygiene factor, on the other hand, affects employee's job satisfaction negatively and discourages them when not satisfied. 

- **Matthew** - Herzberg’s Two-Factor Theory brings up hygiene and motivational factors. Hygiene factors cannot increase job satisfaction or motivation. However, when hygiene factors are not present, they decrease satisfaction and motivation. Motivational factors, such as recognition, can increase satisfaction and motivation in the workplace. If employees are consistently being recognized for their efforts, this can make them feel valued.

- **Jaimi** - Herzberg’s Two-Factor theory describes two sets of factors.  The presence of motivator factors increases satisfaction, while the presence of hygiene factors decreases dissatisfaction.

- **Tim** - When there aren’t any hygiene factors within the workplace, it generally decreases overall satisfaction and motivation. However, when motivating factors are in play, they tend to increase job satisfaction.

- **Paulo** - Job satisfaction and motivation relate to Herzberg’s Two-Factor Theory as hygiene and motivator factors come into play. Hygiene factors are typically considered to be extrinsic motivators such as salary and working conditions whereas motivator factors are more intrinsic such as recognition, work itself, personal growth, and more. When several motivator and hygiene factors are present, it generally tends to increase job satisfaction and motivation.
