- **Gina** - Having a good relationship with the manager and team can be a motivator because this can lead to a good team work that can facilitate resolving problems all together. Also, having less stress with coworkers will give employees more energy to focus on work itself.

- **Matthew** - Time flexibility is a type of motivator in software engineering. Time flexibility is a motivator because allowing employees to have an appropriate work-life balance is, especially, important for workers with families (and even for those without). When people work, they are working for themselves and their families. Having a high work-life balance tells employees that their organization cares about them and their well-being. They are not simply pawns that are being used to make money for the company. Additionally, high work-life balance increases individual productivity, which then turns into increasing organizational productivity. 

- **Jaimi** - Seeing success in your organization’s projects is an example of a motivator, as it satisfies one’s need for financial stability and sense of purpose.

- **Tim** - Money and monetary incentives are considered a motivator. It’s a factor because it is usually associated with people working harder and putting more effort into their work. Most people are highly motivated by money, with many usually asking for how much their salary is during the interview process.

- **Paulo** - One motivator in software engineering is having interesting work. Having interesting work is a motivator because the employee will want to go to work more to continue working on that interesting thing. When an employee is interested in their work it directly increases their job satisfaction and motivation as well as retains the employee for longer (reduces turnover).
