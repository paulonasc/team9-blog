- **Gina** - This can discourage employees from putting in additional effort to develop the required skills to perform the job because they might think their ability does not affect monetary outcomes. 

- **Matthew** - When monetary incentives are given to people who lack the required skills to perform the job, their motivation and effort may be low. This is because (1) they know they won’t be able to perform the job and (2) increasing their total effort will not increase the end reward.

- **Jaimi** - Giving monetary rewards to those that underperform lowers the organization’s performance baseline.  That is, underperformers are encouraged to continue underperforming, and higher performers are encouraged to perform worse.

- **Tim** -  When people lack the skills to perform the job they need to do, no extra effort will be exerted. This is because people won’t be able to perform the job that is required, and don’t see why it is necessary to give more effort.

- **Paulo** - When someone that lacks the required skills to perform a job is given monetary incentives, the person will not put in more effort. The person will generally not put in more effort because they know that they don’t have the skills so it will be hard for them to justify exerting any more effort than they already have.
