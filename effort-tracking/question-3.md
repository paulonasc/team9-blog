- **Gina** - An example of an autonomy-supporting reward would be receiving a compliment from the supervisor about the task done. This is a type of intrinsic motivation. Autonomy-threatening is the opposite one. It does not give you something when you do something but does not give something when you don’t meet the criteria.  

- **Matthew** - An example of an autonomy-supporting reward is receiving a bonus based on your effort on a certain task. An autonomy-threatening reward would be something like, if you did not achieve a certain standard, you would not receive a bonus. The autonomy-threatening reward acts more like a punishment. If you do not reach a certain baseline, you do not get this certain reward. Autonomy-supporting rewards usually cause higher levels of intrinsic motivation while autonomy-threatening rewards cause high levels of extrinsic motivation.

- **Jaimi** - An autonomy-supporting reward is one that doesn’t encroach on the receiver based on their performance or choices, or provides diversity in conjunction with other rewards being offered.  So long as either criteria is met, any reward can qualify.  Autonomy-threatening rewards tend to be functionally controlling, meaning they’re presented in such a way that their delivering or withholding should encourage or discourage behaviors.  Autonomy-supporting rewards lead to intrinsic motivation, while autonomy-threatening rewards lead to extrinsic motivation.

- **Tim** - An example of an autonomy-supporting reward would be receiving free food depending on if the quota for the time period was completed. If it was completed, free food would be provided that day. An autonomy-threatening reward would be almost the opposite, which would be not receiving any free food if the quota was not completed in the time period.

- **Paulo** - An example of an autonomy-supporting reward would be winning gift cards whenever a certain criteria is met. Autonomy-supporting rewards differ from autonomy-threatening rewards as it is the opposite, where in the case of the autonomy-threatening reward, the employee would not receive gift cards if a criteria wasn’t met. Autonomy-threatening rewards generally lead to higher levels of extrinsic motivation whereas autonomy-supporting rewards lead to higher levels of intrinsic motivation.
